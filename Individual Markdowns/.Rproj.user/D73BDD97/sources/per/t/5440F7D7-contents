## Introduction

In this project, we are interested in building a parsimonious model to estimate the life expectancy of individuals depending on various aspects of their residence country. The factors that will be considered for this estimation include: Land Area, Population, Rural Population, Health Care Expenditures, Internet Access, Birth Rate, Elderly Population, CO2 Emissions, GDP, and Cell Phone Subscriptions. The data set provided contains this information for 186 different countries. 

## Results

Statement of model we found to be most ideal and which parameters were involved.

## Methods

Our approach towards achieving our ideal model

## Summary

## Appendix
